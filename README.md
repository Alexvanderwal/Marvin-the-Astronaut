# Marvin-the-Astronaut

## What is this project?

This is a first attempt on creating a Discord bot. It's even my first personal project.
So far i have no clear goal in mind of what the bot can do, or what makes the bot unique. 
The idea for the bot however is that it is set around my interests, so what it could do for example is:

..* Giving fun facts about space, theories about space and the like
..* Sending a random song of the genre you choose
..* Giving reminders about things to do and when
..* And more as soon as i can think of it

## How to add this bot to your server?

I don't know that myself yet but i'll come back to this.

## Calling the bot

You can call the bot thus far with the prefix "Marvin, "
Obviously this isn't an easy or good prefix but it's something i like to use at the moment.
